    "**pdfplumber** is usually praised for handling complex PDF layouts such as tables, but in this particular case, it performed poorly. Unlike PyPDF2, pdfplumber failed to accurately preserve the content structure. It read the content across multiple pages, causing sections of text to be mixed between different pages. This made the result difficult to follow and created a lot of confusion in the flow of the text. Therefore, pdfplumber is less suitable for this specific document."
